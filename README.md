## My take on [pschfr's](https://github.com/pschfr/start) new tab page with keyboard navigation, bookmarks, weather, random quotes and a nice background.

## Features:

* Background is [Heat! by Mushcube](http://mushcube.deviantart.com/art/Heat-376623278)
* Weather from [monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather](https://github.com/monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather)
* Random quote
* Each category of bookmarks can be opened by the keyboard shortcut or by clicking, pressing escape or clicking the background to closes them all
* Clicking a link opens it in a new tab, using the keyboard shortcut opens it in the current tab
* Keyboard navigation is from [ccampbell/mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap)!
* Icon is [flat home icon](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/100-flat-icons-by-graphicloads/home-icon.html)

## Installation:

1. Download/fork the repo
2. Edit whatever you want
  * Bookmark url's, names and keys can be edited in `index.html`
  * Keys to open weather details and open on github are on lines *92-98* in `script.js`
3. Enable developer mode in the `chrome://extensions` page
4. Click `Load unpacked extension...` and choose the directory where all the files are
